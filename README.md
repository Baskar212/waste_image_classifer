# 🗑️ Waste Image Classifier

This project focuses on classifying waste images into predefined categories using deep learning models.
It includes two approaches — a custom CNN and a pretrained ResNet-18 — and provides a user-friendly interface for real-time prediction and confidence display.

🔗 **GitHub Repository**: [waste_image_classifer](https://github.com/Baskar212/waste_image_classifer.git)  
📒 **Final Jupyter Notebook**: `FINAL_dash.ipynb`
